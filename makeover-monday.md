# Assignment: Critique and Re-Design (Makeover Monday)

[Makeover Monday](https://makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a website that has links to data visualizations with public data that you can use to practice critiquing and redesigning data visualizations. 

## Step One: Choose a data visualization from Makeover Monday.
For this assignment, I have chosen to redesign this data visualization, titled: [Mushroom is the UK's most liked pizza topping](https://yougov.co.uk/politics/articles/17714-does-pineapple-belong-pizza). After looking through many of the listed data visualizations on the Makeover Monday website, I ultimately decided to go with this one, primarily because I had a lot to say about it. I thought it was a fun topic, and the picture of the pizza drew me in. I also liked the context of the article. As a hater of pineapple on pizza myself, I was interested in seeing what the UK had to say about it. I was most confused by the slices of the pizza being evenly sliced, leading me to think I was looking at a pie graph, when the slices of the pizza had nothing to do with the data proportions. This is what I most wanted to change in my redesign. 

## Step Two: Critique the data visualization.
The next part of the assignment required using Stephen Few's [Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile](http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/visual_business_intelligence/data_visualization_effectiveness_profile.pdf) as a template to critique the original viz. 

I struggled a lot with this critique. I felt that the context of the article was discussing whether pineapple on pizza was liked, yet the data visualization merely told us that mushrooms were the most liked topping in the UK. I thought a lot about what the difference between "Perceptibility" and "Intuitiveness" was and ultimately settled on the graph being low in perceptibility and high in intuitiveness. This means that the information was unclear and difficult to parse (perception) because of the pie graph hallucination as mentioned before along with no clear focus on mushrooms being the most liked pizza topping, yet it is familiar to a common viewer and doesn't take too much effort to understand in terms of being able to figure it out fairly quickly. I was also confused by the note at the bottom: why omit eight more toppings from the data visualization, especially ones that are ranked highly? I was drawn in by the pizza image, but I felt that the slices were too confusing at a glance and wanted to work on trying to bring the fun pizza feel to my redesign, while making it easier to read. 

## Step Three: Sketch out a solution.
I decided to just go ahead and use Tableau for my draft design. I knew I wanted to do a horizontal bar chart since I thought that would best be able to show all the toppings (even the ones that were omitted from the original graph). I tried to do a pizza color theme but wanted to emphasize UK respondants liking pineapple on pizza as being the main takeaway rather than just most liked toppings. Here was my first draft:
