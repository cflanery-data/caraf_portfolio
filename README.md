# About Me
Hi, my name is Cara Flanery (she/her/hers)!  I'm a Master of Entertainment Industry Management (MEIM) student at Heinz College at CMU! I'm from West Virginia, and my favorite color is orange! I am dedicated, creative, and always willing to learn new things. I bring a diverse skill set in project management, marketing, and content creation. My experience ranges from leading film and digital media projects to managing case files in legal and financial settings. 

I have definitely broadened my horizons by taking this class, Telling Stories with Data. I am very excited to have learned a bit more about GitHub, Tableau, and design, as well as the creation of data visualizations. I hope you enjoy viewing my work, and welcome to my portfolio!

# What I Have Learned
This class is very unique as it draws on multiple disciplines. I have not used any of the software in this class before, so I have definitely brushed up my tech skills throughout the course! 

1. Tableau Basics
2. GitHub Basics
3. HTML and some CSS
4. Better Design Principles (for the Portfolio and for Data Visualizations)
5. Making and maintaining a portfolio
6. Critique Skills

I currently am hoping to work within acquisitions and distributions within the film industry. I am also starting to be more interested in production finance.
