# About Me
Hi, my name is Cara Flanery (she/her/hers)!  I'm a Master of Entertainment Industry Management (MEIM) student at Heinz College at CMU! I'm from West Virginia, and my favorite color is orange! I am dedicated, creative, and always willing to learn new things. I bring a diverse skill set in project management, marketing, and content creation. My experience ranges from leading film and digital media projects to managing case files in legal and financial settings. 

I am looking forward to broadening my horizons by taking this class, Telling Stories with Data, as I'm very excited to learn a bit more about GitHub, Tableau, and design, as well as the creation of data visualizations. I hope you enjoy viewing my work, and welcome to my portfolio!

# What I Hope to Learn
This class is very unique as it draws on multiple disciplines. I have not used any of the software in this class before, so I'm interested in learning how to use them. 

1. Tableau Basics
2. GitHub Basics
3. HTML and (possibly) some CSS
4. Better Design Principles (for the Portfolio and for Data Visualizations)
5. Making and maintaining a portfolio
6. Critique Skills

I currently am hoping to work within acquisitions and distributions within the film industry. I am also starting to be more interested in production finance.

## Future Assignments
Within Telling Stories with Data, I will be learning a lot and creating a lot of data visualizations! Below are some future assignments. 

### Assignment 1: [Visualizing Government Debt](visualizing-government-debt)
This is a future assignment called "Visualizing Government Debt." 

### Assignment 2: [Critique by Design](critique-by-design)
This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `critique-by-design.md`.
