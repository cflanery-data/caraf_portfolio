# User Research and Interviews
## Target Audience

As mentioned in Part One, I want to target filmmakers (both studio and independent filmmakers) and recommend WV as a location for them to consider when creating their next movie. 

Outside of class, I interviewed one Appalachian filmmaker (non-WV) to see if the story works for them, one data analyst, primarily to see if the data is working well, and one WV resident, to get their opinion on the call to action. I chose these three people specifically because they represent different aspects of my story, and I think getting different perspectives will help (as opposed to getting three Appalachian filmmakers, for example). I also got feedback from the in-class exercise, so I was able to get the perspective of other students in the class who have more of a critical eye for the data visualization side, but may not have known as much about the topic itself. 

# Interview Script
## Goals: 
1. Determine if the flow of the story in Shorthand works well.
2. Determine that the data presented and the layout of the visualizations makes sense and is easy to understand. 
3. See if there is information that should be emphasized or excluded based on the opinion of the story. 
4. See if the call to action works.

Based on these goals, here are the initial questions: 
1. What is your initial reaction to the draft?
2. What story do you think is being told? 
3. Were there any data visualizations that came across as unclear or confusing? Did you think they worked well with the flow of the text?
4. Were there any paragraphs that came across as unclear or confusing? 
5. Was there anything you found particularly interesting/surprising/fun that you think should be explored further?
6. Was there anything you found that detracted from the story? 
7. What were your final thoughts by the end of the draft? What were you motivated to do by the end, if anything? 

## Synthesis of Feedback: 
| Questions               | Filmmaker | Data Analyst | WV Resident | Class Group Interview |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| What is your initial reaction to the draft? |             |             |             | Good and cool, interesting topic |

| Were there any data visualizations that came across as unclear or confusing? Did you think they worked well with the flow of the text? |                                |             |             | Georgia passes California â€“ isolating the two states. US map of tax incentives â€“ helps you see how many states are competing |
| Were there any paragraphs that came across as unclear or confusing? |  |  |  | N/A - Did not have Shorthand draft |

Moving Forward to Part Three: 
What changes did I identify? 













# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project.
