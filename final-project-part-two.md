[Link to Shorthand Draft](https://preview.shorthand.com/RdRAC6IES0pRdKg4/responsive/desktop)

Click to link to see the draft version of my final project on Shorthand! It's still currently undergoing revisions. 

_Original Introduction: Introduce the rise of film production in Los Angeles. Bold Canva statistic? Show the history of notable movies made in LA and their budgets. Timeline data visualization with budget points.
Establish that in the past: “Movies = Hollywood.”_

Update: I'm introducing the rise of Hollywood and its timeline, but I am not doing budgets as I don't have that data. I am going to establish that "Movies = Hollywood" and use a call-out statistic to emphasize 60% of US filmmaking was in LA. 

_Original Rising Action: On the timeline, highlight when and where the shift from LA occurs. Identify new major production hubs (ie. Georgia, New Mexico, West Virginia). Map data visualization. Explain the role of state tax incentives and rebates. Map data visualization. Comparison showing that where there are strong tax incentives, there should be a correlation of more film production in those states._

Update: Instead of having a second timeline, I've just used color to emphasize the decentralization at the end of the original timeline and used animation to have it gradually show up. Instead of showing a general comparison with strong tax incentives and film production, I'm going to specifically call out a comparison using a table of California, Georgia, and WV since those are the three states of interest. 

_Original Climax: Georgia is rapidly growing in production. In 2018, “more major feature films were produced in Georgia than in California” (How Atlanta Overtook Hollywood: Roundabout Atlanta, 2023). Show high-profile productions filmed in Georgia (ex. The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013), Avengers: Infinity War (2018)). Focus on West Virginia as a growing production state. On the map from before, highlight WV’s tax incentives. Give examples of movies that have been filmed there recently (ex. Feast of the Seven Fishes (2019))._

Update: I think this works well, and I'm going to keep this general structure. However, instead of using the map from before to highlight WV, I'm going to give that its own data visualization, perhaps a Canva statistic for this. I am still going to give examples of production that has happened in WV to build interest for those works. 

_Original Falling Action: Explore economic growth in these new regions: job creation and discovery of local talent. Contrast with what is happening to California’s share._

Update: I am keeping this. I am going to make some sort of data visualization showing the economic growth in revenue. I am also going to show some statistics about job creation and local talent. I am going to show the decline of the market share in California from 2023 to 2024, but give a hopeful statement that even though there is a decline in California, for filmmakers, there is opportunity to create just as high quality works in locations that may be more budget-friendly.

_Original Resolution/Call to Action: Reflect that decentralization is leading to economic growth outside of California. Emphasize that though these other states are growing, we are not forgetting Hollywood. Discuss opportunities that states like WV could do to continue to attract production. Call to Action: As mentioned before, support local film initiatives, consider WV as filmmakers’ next filming location with links to relevant information._

Update: I may have to change that we are "not forgetting Hollywood" depending on the data, as it shows that moving outside the state means we are taking away from California's share of the revenue. I am going to keep giving ideas of opportunities that WV could try to continue to attract production. And the call to action will be kept as "Consider WV for your next production. Here are some local film initiatives to partner with. Here is film tax program information" using a button in Shorthand that will link to those websites. 

# User Research and Interviews
## Target Audience

As mentioned in Part One, I want to target filmmakers (both studio and independent filmmakers) and recommend WV as a location for them to consider when creating their next movie. 

Outside of class, I interviewed one Appalachian filmmaker (non-WV) to see if the story works for them, one data analyst, primarily to see if the data is working well, and one WV resident, to get their opinion on the call to action. I chose these three people specifically because they represent different aspects of my story, and I think getting different perspectives will help (as opposed to getting three Appalachian filmmakers, for example). I also got feedback from the in-class exercise, so I was able to get the perspective of other students in the class who have more of a critical eye for the data visualization side, but may not have known as much about the topic itself. 

# Interview Script
## Goals: 
1. Determine if the flow of the story in Shorthand works well.
2. Determine that the data presented and the layout of the visualizations makes sense and is easy to understand. 
3. See if there is information that should be emphasized or excluded based on the opinion of the story. 
4. See if the call to action works.

Based on these goals, here are the initial questions: 
1. What is your initial reaction to the draft?
2. What story do you think is being told? 
3. Were there any data visualizations that came across as unclear or confusing? Did you think they worked well with the flow of the text?
4. Were there any paragraphs that came across as unclear or confusing? 
5. Was there anything you found particularly interesting/surprising/fun that you think should be explored further?
6. Was there anything you found that detracted from the story? 
7. What were your final thoughts by the end of the draft? What were you motivated to do by the end, if anything? 

## Interview Answers: 
### 1. What is your initial reaction to the draft?
- Filmmaker: It’s really good! Its got great visuals, has good color and a nice flow to it that makes it really engaging!!
- Data Analyst: Really interesting project right away! Super captivating immediately.
- WV Resident: Interesting concept to present about and aesthetically smooth and easy to digest
- Class Group Interview: Good and cool, interesting topic.

### 2. What story do you think is being told?
- Filmmaker: How film production is moving away from LA, with Georgia rising and West Virginia stepping onto the scene. It's got a mix of history and econ and also talks about how film production has moved away from California and gone to a more diversified, nationwide industry. Especially in smaller states
- Data Analyst: About how films have shifted away from being based/filmed in LA/California as a whole to other areas of the US and why from a tax and business perspective. What the tax incentives are for directors to film elsewhere.
- WV Resident: How film can be produced in other areas of the country, other than just LA/standard "Hollywood." Tells a story about how we can redirect how we know film.
- Class Group Interview: Movie industry is healthy and growing and it’s growing in places you might not expect. Positive in that it’s more decentralized now – people everywhere can aspire to be an actor.

### 3. Were there any data visualizations that came across as unclear or confusing? Did you think they worked well with the flow of the text?
- Filmmaker: Not yet — but placeholders and notes show what’s coming. Just make sure they’re clear and well-labeled when added. The black “Lets explore Hollywood should have some background, just black felt like it was missing something right after “Opening credits.” The lights camera action part could be bigger. The photo is cool but there is a lot of blank space
- Data Analyst: They come up strongly. Favorite one is of the 48 states, but the only caveat is the glitches right now. Maybe have the explanation of the tax incentives first then the map. Variation in the units for the bar charts would be better to be consistent.
- WV Resident: Data was pretty easy to digest and understand, maybe just some direct statements about the WV film industry would be a nice visual.
- Class Group Interview: Georgia passes California – isolating the two states would be cool to see. US map of tax incentives helps you see how many states are competing

### 4. Were there any paragraphs that came across as unclear or confusing?
- Filmmaker: Just the “Different Types of Tax Credits” part. I’m guessing you’re gonna add more to that
- Data Analyst: Paragraphs were clear.
- WV Resident: Paragraphs were not confusing!
- Class Group Interview: Nope!

### 5. Was there anything you found particularly interesting/surprising/fun that you think should be explored further?
- Filmmaker: Yes! West Virginia’s rise is super interesting — adding local examples or images would be great. West Virginia’s rise was cool and maybe adding some examples. The tax reasons and invectives are really important to note, but maybe adding some tv or film examples of what has shot there could help spruce it up a bit. I see you have the film examples coming so that’s awesome! Maybe even how the area is similar to hollywoods, in that the areas are great to shoot in for either landscape, outdoor sets, the community or something to add more than just tax reasons.
- Data Analyst: The 48 states were my favorite because it was really easy to see the contrast between the different state incentives. I would like to see more about how Georgia is different from California. And also, why Georgia over Vermont, for example? Another thing that would be interesting to look into is the question of who picks where the film will be produced?  Who is the one selecting the sites: is it the director, the production accountant, etc.? And are there any influences from directors who have ties to their home states?
- WV Resident: I think that's the amount of films that have come out of Georgia and WV would be a good statistic to add.
- Class Group Interview: We would like to see more about budgets - is it cheaper to make in one state versus another based on wages, accomodations, transportation costs/traffic, incidentals, etc.

### 6. Was there anything you found that detracted from the story?
- Filmmaker: The map Film incentive is hard to read. The colors of the US key on the right hand side of the map page should have a brighter color because the gray mixes in with the black background. The part about Georgia needs more, and I see its still a work in progress so that’s awesome! It also takes a while to get to why West Virginia because to focuses on CA and GA for a bit so make sure that focus is met early on.
- Data Analyst: Really unique topic that I didn't know much about. So to me, nothing detracted, just interested to learn more and more!
- WV Resident: I was intrigued until the end. Didn't find it boring or repetitive in any way!
- Class Group Interview: We didn't think anything detracted.

### 7. What were your final thoughts by the end of the draft? What were you motivated to do by the end, if anything?
- Filmmaker: I wanted to read more about West Virginia’s film growth. It left me feeling to keep an eye out for what may come in West Virginia. Is there any other reasons why California is on the decline? Adding both WV and CA could help make the story well rounded and why CA is on the decline. Why they are not doing as well as others. It’s cool about taxes but maybe a just final “why is this state a good choice” a final thought maybe
- Data Analyst: I really liked it and it makes me think of international implications, such as Bollywood and some research that I know about Nigeria. I want to learn more and share the draft with other people.
- WV Resident: I want to look into WV films more. The main thing I think about is _Buckwild_ which is probably an injustice to the film industry here.
- Class Group Interview: It makes us want to learn more about the topic and look into budgeting in WV and other states.
