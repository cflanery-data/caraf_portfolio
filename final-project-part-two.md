# User Research and Interviews
## Target Audience

As mentioned in Part One, I want to target filmmakers (both studio and independent filmmakers) and recommend WV as a location for them to consider when creating their next movie. 

Outside of class, I interviewed one Appalachian filmmaker (non-WV) to see if the story works for them, one data analyst, primarily to see if the data is working well, and one WV resident, to get their opinion on the call to action. I chose these three people specifically because they represent different aspects of my story, and I think getting different perspectives will help (as opposed to getting three Appalachian filmmakers, for example). I also got feedback from the in-class exercise, so I was able to get the perspective of other students in the class who have more of a critical eye for the data visualization side, but may not have known as much about the topic itself. 

# Interview Script
## Goals: 
1. Determine if the flow of the story in Shorthand works well.
2. Determine that the data presented and the layout of the visualizations makes sense and is easy to understand. 
3. See if there is information that should be emphasized or excluded based on the opinion of the story. 
4. See if the call to action works.

Based on these goals, here are the initial questions: 
1. What is your initial reaction to the draft?
2. What story do you think is being told? 
3. Were there any data visualizations that came across as unclear or confusing? Did you think they worked well with the flow of the text?
4. Were there any paragraphs that came across as unclear or confusing? 
5. Was there anything you found particularly interesting/surprising/fun that you think should be explored further?
6. Was there anything you found that detracted from the story? 
7. What were your final thoughts by the end of the draft? What were you motivated to do by the end, if anything? 

## Synthesis of Feedback: 
| Questions               | Filmmaker | Data Analyst | WV Resident | Class Group Interview |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| What is your initial reaction to the draft? | It’s really good! Its got great visuals, has good color and a nice flow to it that makes it really engaging!! |             |             | Good and cool, interesting topic |
| What story do you think is being told? | How film production is moving away from LA, with Georgia rising and West Virginia stepping onto the scene. It's got a mix of history and econ and also talks about how film production has moved away from California and gone to a more diversified, nationwide industry. Especially in smaller states |             |             | Movie industry is healthy and growing and it’s growing in places you might not expect. Positive in that it’s more decentralized now – people everywhere can aspire to be an actor. |
| Were there any data visualizations that came across as unclear or confusing? Did you think they worked well with the flow of the text? | Not yet — but placeholders and notes show what’s coming. Just make sure they’re clear and well-labeled when added. The black “Lets explore Hollywood should have some background, just black felt like it was missing something right after “Opening credits.” The lights camera action part could be bigger. The photo is cool but there is a lot of blank space |             |             | Georgia passes California – isolating the two states. US map of tax incentives – helps you see how many states are competing |
| Were there any paragraphs that came across as unclear or confusing? | Just the “Different Types of Tax Credits” part. I’m guessing you’re gonna add more to that |  |  | N/A - Did not have Shorthand draft |
| Was there anything you found particularly interesting/surprising/fun that you think should be explored further? | Yes! West Virginia’s rise is super interesting — adding local examples or images would be great. West Virginia’s rise was cool and maybe adding some examples. The tax reasons and invectives are really important to note, but maybe adding some tv or film examples of what has shot there could help spruce it up a bit. I see you have the film examples coming so that’s awesome! Maybe even how the area is similar to hollywoods, in that the areas are great to shoot in for either landscape, outdoor sets, the community or something to add more than just tax reasons. |  |  | x |
| Was there anything you found that detracted from the story? |  The map Film incentive is hard to read. The colors of the US key on the right hand side of the map page should have a brighter color because the gray mixes in with the black background. The part about Georgia needs more, and I see its still a work in progress so that’s awesome! It also takes a while to get to why West Virginia because to focuses on CA and GA for a bit so make sure that focus is met early on
| | | x |
| What were your final thoughts by the end of the draft? What were you motivated to do by the end, if anything? | I wanted to read more about West Virginia’s film growth. It left me feeling to keep an eye out for what may come in West Virginia. Is there any other reasons why California is on the decline? Adding both WV and CA could help make the story well rounded and why CA is on the decline. Why they are not doing as well as others. It’s cool about taxes but maybe a just final “why is this state a good choice” a final thought maybe | | | x | 


Moving Forward to Part Three: 
What changes did I identify? 













# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project.
