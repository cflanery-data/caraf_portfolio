# Working with Tableau: Visualizing Government Debt
For each data visualization exercise, you will be provided with a dataset and you'll have to figure out the story to tell with that particular dataset. Using what youâ€™ve learned in class and one of the identified technical tools, it will be your job to construct a compelling narrative and data visualization that can stand up to the critique methodologies you learned in previous coursework.  You will be graded on how well you can both articulate your story through the data visualization as well as how you construct the elements found in the data visualization.  

For this assignment you'll be working with a web-based visualization tool, and later designing your own visualizations with Tableau.  Exercises like these will provide you with a hands-on opportunity to demonstrate your proficiency in a number of tools and techniques you learn during this course.

For this assignment, you have the option of adding some of these visualizations to your online portfolio.  A good place to do that is on the dataviz examples page on your portfolio.
